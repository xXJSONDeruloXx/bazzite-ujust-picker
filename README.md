### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery:

- Pushing to the `main` branch automatically creates a new tag and triggers a release
- Tags are created using the current date (YYYY-MM-DD) format
- Multiple releases on the same day will have an incrementing counter (e.g., 2025-05-31.1, 2025-05-31.2)
- Binary builds are created for Linux (x86_64 and arm64)
- Releases are automatically published to GitHub Releases

The workflow configuration is in `.github/workflows/release.yml` and uses GoReleaser for building and packaging.
